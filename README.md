# instructions
run FrontEnd.py
interact with the tkinter interface for all functions,
find different quirks and proper use instructions on the "About Page",
The only place you will need to alter the root password is the AddObjects.py file,
the database dump is in a file called data-dump.sql I looked through and saw our view mentioned but I do not know if it'll build correctly

# dataset
The dataset was built by us, we attempted to have an AI build a dataset but it would not build anything accurate or usable so we abandoned the AI and found the data ourselves
